# sentiment-bot

> a GitHub App built with [probot](https://github.com/probot/probot) that replies to toxic comments with a maintainer designated reply and a link to the repo's code of conduct. It does so by taking data from a `.github/config.yml`.

You can tell from this example just how toxic I am ðŸ˜œ

## Usage

1. Install the bot on the intended repositories. The plugin requires the following **Permissions and Events**:
- Issues: **Read & Write**
  - [x] check the box for **Issue Comment** events
2. Add a `.github/config.yml` file that contains the following:

```yml
# Configuration for sentiment-bot - https://github.com/behaviorbot/sentiment-bot

# *Required* toxicity threshold between 0 and .99 with the higher numbers being the most toxic
# Anything higher than this threshold will be marked as toxic and commented on
sentimentBotToxicityThreshold: .7

# *Required* Comment to reply with
sentimentBotReplyComment: >
  Please be sure to review the code of conduct and be respectful of other users. cc/ @hiimbex

```
3. Be sure to check out the [Perspective API](https://www.perspectiveapi.com/) before choosing your toxicity threshold to get a feel for what kind of comments would register at what toxicity threshold.

## Setup

```
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the bot
npm start
```

See [the probot deployment docs](https://github.com/probot/probot/blob/master/docs/deployment.md) if you would like to run your own instance of this plugin.
